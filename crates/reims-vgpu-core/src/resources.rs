//! Resources: the guest's buffers, heaps, indirect command buffers and textures, each backed by a
//! Metal object that is made, paged and released at fixed points.
//!
//! A [`Resource`](resource::Resource) is its validity flags ([`validity`]) and its kind
//! ([`ResourceKind`](resource::ResourceKind)). Which kind answers which operation is the
//! [`ResourceClass`](resource::ResourceClass) trait: its default methods are the answers a kind
//! gives when it does not override them, and an operation a kind does not answer raises
//! [`RaiseKind::Unrecognized`]. The kinds are [`buffer`], [`heap`], [`icb`] and [`texture`];
//! [`host`] is what a resource asks of its task.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! What callers and the guest observe, each held by the tests named (under each module's
//! `tests`):
//! - **Bind at first use.** A kind that reads guest pages asks the task for them only while it
//!   holds none (or is detached), once per life; only a discard, a failed plane and the last
//!   release drop them (`buffer::shared::prepare_with_cpu_rebinds_once_after_discard`,
//!   `heap::legacy::prepare::transfer_buffer_is_kept_until_discard`).
//! - **Validity is written after encoding.** A prepare sets host-valid after its copy is
//!   encoded, a synchronize guest-valid after; they mean "encoded", not "completed"
//!   (`buffer::private::prepare::binds_the_guest_pages_once_and_copies_up`).
//! - **Devolatilizing comes first** in a private buffer's and a legacy heap's prepare, and may
//!   clear host-valid before it is tested; a synchronize never devolatilizes
//!   (`buffer::private::discard_devolatilize::devolatilize_recopies_only_when_emptied`).
//! - **Placement write-back** (detach buffer and heap) happens before the nil check, only into a
//!   zero slot (`buffer::detach::init::write_back_only_into_a_zero_slot`).
//! - **Mapper surfaces**: retained before the buffer is made, released once per made buffer at
//!   a discard or the last release, and at once when Metal refuses the buffer
//!   (`buffer::mapper_ref::discard::discard_releases_the_surface_once`).
//! - **Which kind answers which operation**, including which raise
//!   [`RaiseKind::Unrecognized`]: `resource::responds_table`.
//! - **Values kept for good** ([`crate::raise::kept`]), one test per rule this area has: a Metal
//!   object whose resource index or GPU VA later placements are numbered after,
//!   `MetalNumbering` (the detach heap's cover buffer,
//!   `heap::detach::accessors::last_release_leaks_the_cover_buffer_and_frees_the_dummy`; what a
//!   creation made before a raise, `buffer::detach::init::a_detach_raise_leaks_the_buffer`); a
//!   surface retain nobody takes back, `SurfaceUseCount`
//!   (`buffer::mapper_ref::discard::a_gone_task_leaks_the_extra_retain`,
//!   `buffer::mapper_ref::prepare::a_make_raise_leaks_the_surface_retain`). What a creation made
//!   that holds nothing Metal, or that no path reaches, is released on its raise
//!   (`buffer::shared::tests::a_task_raise_propagates_out_of_the_creation`).
//!
//! Metal's objects are made in order and released at their last release: a kind holding two or more
//! handles takes them in a fixed order in its `Drop`.
